# @ts-gql/apollo

This package provides more specific TypeScript types for use with `@ts-gql/apollo`, it can still be used but likely will not be improved. The recommended approach is now to use the `@apollo/client` package directly but this package still exists for easy migration.

[See the changelog for more details](CHANGELOG.md).
